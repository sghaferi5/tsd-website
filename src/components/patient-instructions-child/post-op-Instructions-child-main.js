                            <p>Your child should be monitored by a responsible adult for the remainder of the day (6-8 hours following the appointment). This is to make sure they have completely recovered and they do not suffer a fall or injury while they may still be dizzy or groggy from the anaesthetic.</p>    
                            <p>Your child must rest at home and is not allowed to ride a bike or play outside for the remainder of the day.</p>

                            <p>To ensure your child is properly hydrated, your child should:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Have small sips of water or apple juice as soon as possible after the appointment.</li>
                                <li>Proceed with solid food in moderation. Soft food at moderate or cool temperatures, with low fat, are best after procedures (e.g. fruit smoothies, pudding, lukewarm soup). Nausea and vomiting is not common, but it may occur in some patients after the procedure. Please call our office if any nausea or vomiting lasts greater than 2 hours.
